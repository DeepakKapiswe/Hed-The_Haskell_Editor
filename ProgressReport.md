now what is the current state of the editor

now i have made an interface through which i could represent the state of the actual text object in an abstract manner and also the required minimum functions to transform the textObj

now what are you thinking to do 

now i have to think that how can i display my text object to the terminal so that the user could modify it interctively, for that what i need is
 1> show cursor at correct position --DONE
 2> make the current line always visible i.e support scrolling vertically -- DONE 
 3> i have to display such that the longer lines should be broken and incomplete lines should not be shown to the user they should be replaced with   vaccant lines while displaying --DONE


now i have done the 3rd above mentioned point but now a new porblem i am facing of cursor position misplacement and now i have to comeup with some formula to calculate correctly the cursor position

now i have separated all the functions according to their group of functionality and made a modular model to start work and have focus only on current working problem this would help me for dealing with separate problems separately
